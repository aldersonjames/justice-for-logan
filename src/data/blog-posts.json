This legislation, which we're calling \"Logan's Law,\" represents a significant step toward preventing future tragedies.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\nThe bill includes several critical reforms:\n\n- **Mandatory Risk Assessments**: Judges must consider comprehensive risk assessments before granting bail to defendants charged with violent crimes\n- **Repeat Offender Restrictions**: Stricter bail requirements for individuals with prior violent offense convictions\n- **Victim Notification**: Enhanced notification systems to alert victims when defendants are released\n- **Accountability Measures**: Public reporting requirements for bail decisions and reoffending rates\n\n## Bipartisan Support\n\nWe're encouraged by the bipartisan support this bill has received. Representatives from both parties recognize that public safety transcends political divisions.\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe bill has been assigned to the House Judiciary Committee and is scheduled for hearings in early December. We'll be mobilizing supporters to attend these hearings and testify in support of the legislation.\n\n## Your Voice Matters\n\nContact your representatives and urge them to support HB 2847.
